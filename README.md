## Introduction

Project LEO (Layered Emergent Organism), developed by Kadropic Labs, is a pioneering open-source initiative designed to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a decentralized, layered cognitive architecture. Unlike traditional AI assistants, LEO is built as a self-organizing organism capable of autonomous reasoning, predictive planning, and cryptographic verification without centralized control.

## Vision & Philosophy

At Kadropic Labs, we envision AGI as a decentralized fabric of intelligence. Project LEO is not just a tool; it is a **Decentralized Cognitive Architecture** that combines neuromorphic memory, graph-based reasoning, and Byzantine-resilient consensus to create a system that is simultaneously intelligent, secure, and scalable.

### Core Principles

*   **Emergent Intelligence:** Intelligence arises from the interaction of modular cognitive layers (Memory, Concepts, Planning, Safety).
*   **Decentralized Sovereignty:** Each node maintains its own state and memory, contributing to a global consensus without revealing raw data.
*   **Cryptographic Correctness:** Utilizing Distributed Zero-Knowledge Fragmentation (ZKF) to ensure every reasoning step is verified.
*   **Self-Evolution:** Through Self-Evolving Local Circuits (SELC), LEO dynamically reconstructs its computational pipeline based on task complexity.

## Technical Architecture

Project LEO is structured into distinct but interconnected cognitive modules, as outlined in our technical blueprint:

### 1. Core Consensus Mechanism (Byzantine-Resilient ADMM)
LEO achieves collective reasoning through a distributed optimization protocol based on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). This allows nodes to reach a global consensus state (**w**) while solving local objective functions, ensuring convergence even under adversarial conditions.

### 2. Hierarchical Memory System (STM & LTM)
*   **Short-Term Memory (STM):** A lightweight circular buffer for recent representations and immediate context.
*   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** A self-organizing sparse graph that encodes episodic states and co-activation patterns using Hebbian update rules.

### 3. Conceptual Reasoning & Abstraction
LEO transforms raw observations into latent concept embeddings. A dynamic **Concept Graph** encodes semantic relationships, enabling cross-domain transfer learning and computational compression.

### 4. Predictive Simulation & Planning
Each node maintains a local transition model for forward modeling. Using Monte Carlo Rollouts, LEO simulates potential future trajectories and scores them against goal alignment functions, allowing for adaptive planning depth.

### 5. Multi-Layer Safety & Ethical Control
Safety is baked into the architecture through a **Composite Safety Potential**. Every action is passed through a predictive risk assessment filter, which can block actions or escalate them for human approval based on violation potential.

### 6. Distributed Zero-Knowledge Fragmentation (ZKF)
LEO introduces a breakthrough in cryptographic AI: **ZKF**. Instead of monolithic proofs, correctness is decomposed into micro-attestations. This enables sub-millisecond verification of decentralized reasoning, ensuring that every update is mathematically and semantically consistent.

### 7. Self-Evolving Local Circuits (SELC)
The SELC module allows LEO to dynamically rewrite its internal computation circuit. Based on task signatures, a node can simplify its reasoning path for routine tasks or escalate to deep, verified circuits for high-risk objectives.

## System Flow

The end-to-end processing pipeline follows a sophisticated cognitive flow:
1.  **Input Encoding:** Raw data is transformed into a state representation.
2.  **Memory Reconciliation:** State is reconciled between STM and LTM.
3.  **Conceptual Linking:** Symbolic abstraction and semantic compression.
4.  **Predictive Planning:** Future simulation and action selection.
5.  **Safety Filtering:** Risk assessment and policy enforcement.
6.  **ADMM Consensus:** Distributed agreement and Byzantine resilience.
7.  **ZKF Verification:** Cryptographic proof of correctness.
8.  **Output Generation:** Execution of the verified action.

## Getting Started

Project LEO is designed for ease of deployment, allowing anyone to run their own node in the decentralized intelligence mesh.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KadropicLabs/Project-LEO.git
    cd Project-LEO
    ```
2.  **Run the installation script:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

### Configuration
Configure your node's identity and API access in the `.env` file. LEO supports both local LLMs (via Llama/Ollama) and cloud-based models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash).
