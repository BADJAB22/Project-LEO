## 🚀 Overview

**Project LEO (Layered Emergent Organism)** is a next-generation, decentralized cognitive architecture developed by **Kadropic Labs**. Designed by **Bader Jamal**, LEO represents a fundamental shift from static AI models to a self-organizing, autonomous intelligence mesh. 

LEO is engineered to achieve AGI-level capabilities through a distributed fabric that integrates neuromorphic memory, graph-based reasoning, and Byzantine-resilient consensus mechanisms. It is designed to be simultaneously intelligent, secure, and infinitely scalable without centralized control.

## 🧠 Core Architectural Modules

LEO is built upon a modular framework where intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized cognitive layers:

### 1. Core Consensus (Byzantine-Resilient ADMM)
LEO utilizes a distributed optimization protocol based on **ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)**. This allows the global network to solve complex objective functions:
*   **Local Computation:** Nodes solve local problems based on their unique context.
*   **Secure Aggregation:** Byzantine-resilient aggregators ensure global coherence even if a portion of the network is adversarial.
*   **Convergence:** Guaranteed alignment to a global state (**w**) without a central server.

### 2. Hierarchical Memory System (STM & LTM)
Inspired by human neurobiology, LEO employs a dual-layered memory:
*   **Short-Term Memory (STM):** A high-speed circular buffer for immediate context and sensory processing.
*   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** A sparse, self-organizing graph. Using **Hebbian Update Rules**, LEO consolidates frequent patterns into long-term knowledge nodes and edges.

### 3. Conceptual Reasoning & Dynamic Linking
Beyond raw data, LEO operates on **Concepts**. 
*   **Concept Graphs (CG):** Dynamic structures that encode semantic relationships.
*   **Abstraction:** The system compresses episodic experiences into latent concept embeddings, enabling cross-domain transfer learning.

### 4. Distributed Zero-Knowledge Fragmentation (ZKF-Layer)
A breakthrough in AI safety and privacy. LEO decomposes cryptographic proofs into **micro-attestations**:
*   **Sub-millisecond Verification:** Reasoning steps are verified cryptographically without the latency of traditional ZKPs.
*   **Semantic Consistency:** Small-LMs provide a "checksum" to ensure updates are logically and semantically sound.

### 5. Self-Evolving Local Circuits (SELC)
The **SELC** module is the "Meta-Architectural" layer. It allows LEO nodes to:
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Rewrite their internal computational pipeline based on task complexity.
*   **Path Optimization:** Use "Hot Paths" for routine tasks and "Deep Verified Paths" for high-risk reasoning.
*   **Algorithmic Evolution:** Mutate and evolve reasoning flows over time.

## 🛠 System Flow: The Cognitive Pipeline

Every interaction in LEO follows a rigorous 8-step cognitive process:

1.  **Encoding:** Input is transformed into a latent state.
2.  **Memory Reconciliation:** Interaction between STM and LTM to find relevant history.
3.  **Conceptual Linking:** Mapping the state to the internal Concept Graph.
4.  **Predictive Planning:** Simulating future trajectories via Monte Carlo Rollouts.
5.  **Safety Filtering:** Multi-layer risk assessment (Composite Safety Potential).
6.  **ADMM Consensus:** Reaching agreement with the decentralized mesh.
7.  **ZKF Verification:** Final cryptographic attestation of the process.
8.  **Load Regulation:** Optimizing resource usage before final output.
